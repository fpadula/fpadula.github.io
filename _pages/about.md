Hi! I am a PhD student in the [New Dexterity](https://newdexterity.org/) group at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html). My current research is about transferring dexterous manipulation skills from humans to robots. My interests are robotics, machine learning, computer vision, motion planning and control.

Before studying at the University of Auckland, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science from the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/#english). At USP, I worked on developing a motion policy using deep reinforcement learning and vision for obstacle avoidance for a robotic arm.

For my work, I use and integrate different technologies and techniques, such as (but not limited to) ROS, Linux, machine learning, and computer vision. For more information, please check my [publications](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) pages. Feel free to contact me using the links at the bottom of the page.
